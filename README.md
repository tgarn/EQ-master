# Seismic Activity Machine Learning Predictor
## A python based machine learning project 

Using Jupyter notebooks to do and present machine learning work.

The programs predicts where and EQ will take place based on the depth of the event taking place.

The program also predicts what event caused the seismic activity(Earthquake, Volcano, nucular explosion. based on where it took place.
